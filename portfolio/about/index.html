            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Jacob Hornbeck, and I love web development and programming. If you would like
                to see a list of languages and technologies that I know, scroll all the way to the
                <a href="#bottom">bottom</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I first learned programming my last year of middle school. When my online school,
                Washington Virtual Academy (WAVA), had a kind of career fair, my favorite teacher
                was hosting one about "coding". Since I had no idea which one I wanted to go to,
                I just chose the one my favorite teacher was hosting.
            </p>
            <p>
                That "coding" ended up being Khan Academy's Hour of Code. I loved what I learned so
                much, I went on to take their full course on programming (they use a modified version
                of Processing.js). By the time I started Running Start (doing college in high school)
                with Lower Columbia College (LCC), I had finished the course and had started their web
                development course (which taught HTML and CSS). And since I loved programming, I knew
                exactly what I was going to go into for college.
            </p>
            <p>
                I continued my learning on Khan Academy while attending LCC, and so when I graduated
                LCC with my Associate in Computer Science, I had finished the web development course,
                started and finished another web development course (which taught using JavaScript
                with HTML). The classes I took to get my degree, taught me a lot of programming
                techniques in Object-Oriented languages (4 classes in C++ and 1 in Java, but the
                concepts apply to all object-oriented languages).
            </p>
            <p>
                I then moved to Idaho and started at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.byui.edu/">
                Brigham Young University - Idaho</a> (BYUI), to get a Bachelor's Degree in Software
                Engineering (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.byui.edu/catalog#/programs/4kNfm-2oZ/">view details</a>).
                I also got two certificates:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>C145 - Computer Programming (<a target="_blank" href="">view details</a>)</li>
                <li>C175 - Web Design and Development (<a target="_blank" href="">view details</a>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I learned so much more at BYU-Idaho than I did at LCC, even though I spent about the same
                time at each school. At LCC I had to take a lot more generals than I had to take at
                BYU-Idaho (not because they require less, but because my generals from LCC transferred
                to BYUI and covered almost all of them). Taking mostly programming and web development
                classes was really great, since I was learning more about and doing what I love.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an avid web developer, both frontend and backend, but enjoy frontend more. Web
                development technologies/languages that I know are <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> (also
                <b>SCSS</b>), <b>JavaScript</b> (also <b>TypeScript</b>), <b>Angular Framework</b>
                (<i>not</i> AngularJS), <b>NodeJS</b> (managing packages using NPM), <b>ExpressJS</b>
                (used with NodeJS), <b>EJS - Embedded JavaScript Templating</b> (templating used with
                NodeJS and ExpressJS), <b>MongoDB Atlas</b> (using MongoDB and Mongoose NPM libraries),
                <b>PHP</b> (definitely not as good with this as I am with NodeJS), and <b>SQL</b> (I've
                learned a few of them, but only have experience with Oracle's MySQL).
            </p>
            <p>
                I know quite a few programming languages, but I really haven't had much experience
                in terms of building actual software. The programs I built were pretty much all
                applications that ran in the console. The following are programming languages that I
                have experience with and feel at least somewhat confident programming in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>C++</b></li>
                <li><b>Python</b></li>
                <li><b>JavaScript</b></li>
                <li><b>TypeScript</b></li>
                <li><b>Java</b></li>
                <li><b>PHP</b></li>
                <li><b>Bash</b></li>
            </ul>
