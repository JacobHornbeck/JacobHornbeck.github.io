            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Jacob Hornbeck.</p>
            <p>
                I was homeschooled all but 3<sup>rd</sup> grade and high school. My last year of middle school,
                I received high school credit from some of my classes, which allowed me to skip my freshman year.
                I started at Lower Columbia College (LCC), doing Running Start, and so when I graduated high school (a few months after I turned 17),
                I had both my High School Diploma and an Associates Degree in Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering,
                with a certificate in Web Design & Development and a certificate in Software Design.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love programming, web development, solving Rubik's cubes, cycling (mostly mountain biking),
                riding my unicycle, riding rip-sticks, climbing trees, playing ultimate frisbee, playing soccer (just for fun),
                playing on my slack-line (I can't do any tricks yet, I'm just learning to walk across it better), and more.
