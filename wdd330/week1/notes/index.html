                    In this course, he talks about reachability and how when people are on their
                    mobile device, either one handed or two, it is harder for them to reach the
                    top navigation menu where most websites have it. I've never really thought
                    about that fact, from now on, when I am making a responsive website, I will
                    make sure that in the mobile screen the "top" header is at the bottom to be
                    easily reachable on the phone.
